Section 1.1: System Overview

  QA LTD is a leading training provider in the United Kingdom involved in Professional training, Higher Education, Apprenticeships and Consulting services (https://www.qa.com/).
  QA’s Higher Education (QAHE) services are delivered via partnerships with UK Universities such as University of Ulster, Northumbria University, University of Roehampton, 
  Solent University, Middlesex University and London Metropolitan university.

  The COVID-19 Pandemic has resulted in a shift to online learning as well as the need for social distancing, if physical presence is required.
  The scheduling team, alongside other departments, was very swift in making the transition to online delivery during the lockdown situation which began in March 2020. 
  However, now the lockdown situation is subsiding, there is now a need to gradually move back to face-to-face delivery, keeping social distancing rules in mind.
  
Section 1.2: Our Mission

  At QAHE , the typical class group has about 20-30 students in a regular classroom and about 40-60 students in the lecture theatre. 
  However, the problem is that, with social distancing factored in, the room may only be able to take around half to one-third of the usual numbers.
  
  To curb this challenge, one possible solution is to split the class into two or three groups (e.g. Group 1 and Group 2) and have one group attend face-to-face while the other group attends online and alternate this weekly.
  For example, in Week 1, Group 1 will attend face-to-face while Group 2 will join via an online platform e.g. WebEx. For Week 2, the reverse will be the case – Group 1 will attend online while Group 2 will attend a face-to-face session. 
  This will continue in an alternate fashion until the end of the semester, usually in 11-12 weeks in total.
  Lecturer will be delivering both face-to-face and online sessions at the same time, using our technology.
